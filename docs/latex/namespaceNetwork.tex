\subsection{Detailed Description}
Constructs a \mbox{\hyperlink{classNetwork_1_1Manager}{Network\+::\+Manager}} facade to access the network using the H\+T\+TP protocol. The \mbox{\hyperlink{classNetwork_1_1Manager}{Network\+::\+Manager}} facade makes network access in Qt abstract from the underlying library (Q\+Network\+Access\+Manager, lib\+Curl, ...).

Constructs a \mbox{\hyperlink{classNetwork_1_1Manager}{Network\+::\+Manager}} if none exists and returns the instance.

Retrieves a certain resource from the given Q\+Url \&url using a G\+ET request. The result as a Q\+Network\+Reply $\ast$reply will be available as soon as the request\+Completed signal is fired.

Posts data to a certain resource from the given Q\+Url url using a P\+O\+ST request. The result as a Q\+Network\+Reply $\ast$reply will be available as soon as the request\+Completed signal is fired.

Deletes a certain resource from the given Q\+Url url using a D\+E\+L\+E\+TE request. The result as a Q\+Network\+Reply $\ast$reply will be available as soon as the request\+Completed signal is fired.

Retrieves the headers of the resource from the given Q\+Url url using a H\+E\+AD request. The result as a Q\+Network\+Reply $\ast$reply will be available as soon as the request\+Completed signal is fired.

Everytime a H\+T\+TP request has been made by the user it needs several default headers to complete it\textquotesingle{}s mission. The prepare\+Request method just does that, it adds the Accept, User-\/\+Agent header to the request and allows redirects.

Retrieves the current user agent used to make requests in this H\+T\+TP instance.

Changes the current user agent to the given Q\+String.

Retrieves the current accept header used to make requests in this H\+T\+TP instance.

Changes the current accept header to the given Q\+String.

Gets the Q\+Network\+Access\+Manager instance.

Sets the Q\+Network\+Access\+Manager instance.

Gets the Q\+Abstract\+Network\+Cache instance.

Sets the Q\+Abstract\+Network\+Cache instance.
