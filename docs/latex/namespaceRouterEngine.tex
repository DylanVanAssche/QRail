\subsection{Detailed Description}
Constructs a \mbox{\hyperlink{classRouterEngine_1_1Planner}{Planner}} to plan routes using the Connection Scan Algorithm (C\+SA).

Constructs a \mbox{\hyperlink{classRouterEngine_1_1Planner}{Router\+Engine\+::\+Planner}} if none exists and returns the instance.

Retrieves the connections between 2 stations with a given departure time and a maximum of transfers. Emit the routes\+Found signal when completed, the error signal is emitted in case an error comes up.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This method runs in a separated thread using the Qt\+Concurrent framework. Runs the Connection Scan Algorithm (C\+SA) on a single \mbox{\hyperlink{classFragments_1_1Page}{Fragments\+::\+Page}} page. In case we need to fetch more pages, the \mbox{\hyperlink{classFragments_1_1Factory}{Fragments\+::\+Factory}} is contacted to retrieve those pages while processing the current page. The order is very important, that\textquotesingle{}s why only 1 page at the time may be processed.
\end{DoxyNote}
