Emit the finished signal when completed, the error signal is emitted in case an error comes up.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This method runs in a separated thread using the Qt\+Concurrent framework. Runs the Connection Scan Algorithm (C\+SA) on a single \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1Fragments_1_1Page}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Fragments\+::\+Page}} page. In case we need to fetch more pages, the \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1Fragments_1_1Factory}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Fragments\+::\+Factory}} is contacted to retrieve those pages while processing the current page. The order is very important, that\textquotesingle{}s why only 1 page at the time may be processed.
\end{DoxyNote}
When a page is received from the \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1Fragments_1_1Factory}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Fragments\+::\+Factory}} this handler will launch a separate thread to process the page.

The transfers are generated from the list of legs.

Delays are already included in this timestamp. Gets the arrival time of the route and returns it.
