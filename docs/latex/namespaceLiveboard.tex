\subsection{Detailed Description}
Constructs a \mbox{\hyperlink{classLiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} with the given parent.

Adds an entry (\mbox{\hyperlink{classVehicleEngine_1_1Vehicle}{Vehicle\+Engine\+::\+Vehicle}} $\ast$) to the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceLiveboard}{Liveboard}} entries. Using this method will automatically set the entries to the appended list and trigger the entries\+Changed signal.

Gets the station of the liveboard and returns it.

Sets the station of the liveboard to the given \mbox{\hyperlink{classStationEngine_1_1Station}{Station\+Engine\+::\+Station}} $\ast$station. Emits the station\+Changed signal.

Gets the until time and returns it.

Sets the until time to the given Q\+Date\+Time \&until. Emits the until\+Changed signal.

Gets the mode and returns it.

Sets the mode of the liveboard to the given Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board\+::\+Mode \&mode. Emits the mode\+Changed signal.

Gets the from time and returns it.

Sets the from time to the given Q\+Date\+Time \&from. Emits the from\+Changed signal.

Gets the entries of the liveboard and returns it.

Sets the entries of the liveboard to the given Q\+List$<$\+Vehicle\+Engine\+::\+Vehicle $\ast$$>$ \&entries. Emits the entries\+Changed signal.

Constructs a \mbox{\hyperlink{classLiveboardEngine_1_1Factory}{Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Factory}} to generate \mbox{\hyperlink{classLiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} objects on the fly.

Constructs a \mbox{\hyperlink{classLiveboardEngine_1_1Factory}{Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Factory}} if none exists and returns the instance.

This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It differs from the above function only in what argument(s) it accepts.

Retrieves a \mbox{\hyperlink{classLiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} for a station given by it\textquotesingle{}s U\+RI. The Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board\+::\+Mode \&mode parameter determines if the the liveboard should contain all the arrivals, departures of the station. Calling this method will retrieve a \mbox{\hyperlink{classLiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} for the current time until the current time + 3 hours.

This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It differs from the above function only in what argument(s) it accepts.

Retrieves a \mbox{\hyperlink{classLiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} for a station given by it\textquotesingle{}s U\+RI. The Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board\+::\+Mode \&mode parameter determines if the the liveboard should contain all the arrivals, departures of the station.

Handles the incoming \mbox{\hyperlink{classFragments_1_1Page}{Fragments\+::\+Page}} pages from the \mbox{\hyperlink{classFragments_1_1Factory}{Fragments\+::\+Factory}}. New pages are requested if the time range isn\textquotesingle{}t fulfilled in D\+E\+S\+C\+E\+N\+D\+I\+NG order of the departure time.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
If you want to retrieve the full intermediary stops of each vehicle in the \mbox{\hyperlink{classLiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} you can use the \mbox{\hyperlink{classVehicleEngine_1_1Factory}{Vehicle\+Engine\+::\+Factory}}.
\end{DoxyNote}
Parses the incoming pages in a separate thread using the Qt\+Concurrent framework. If the finished parameter is set to true, the \mbox{\hyperlink{classLiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} is ready and the liveboard\+Ready signal is emitted.

Gets the \mbox{\hyperlink{classLiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} instance we\textquotesingle{}re currently using and returns it.

Sets the \mbox{\hyperlink{classLiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} instance we\textquotesingle{}re currently using to the given \mbox{\hyperlink{classLiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} $\ast$liveboard.

Gets the \mbox{\hyperlink{classStationEngine_1_1Factory}{Station\+Engine\+::\+Factory}} instance and returns it.

Sets the \mbox{\hyperlink{classStationEngine_1_1Factory}{Station\+Engine\+::\+Factory}} instance to the given \mbox{\hyperlink{classStationEngine_1_1Factory}{Station\+Engine\+::\+Factory}} $\ast$stationfactory.

Gets the Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board\+::\+Mode mode and returns it.

Gets the station U\+RI and returns it.

Sets the station U\+RI to the given Q\+Url \&station\+U\+RI. Emits the station\+U\+R\+I\+Changed signal.

Gets the \mbox{\hyperlink{classFragments_1_1Factory}{Fragments\+::\+Factory}} instance and returns it.

Sets the \mbox{\hyperlink{classFragments_1_1Factory}{Fragments\+::\+Factory}} instance to the given \mbox{\hyperlink{classFragments_1_1Factory}{Fragments\+::\+Factory}} $\ast$factory.
