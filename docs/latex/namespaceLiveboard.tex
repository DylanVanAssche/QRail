Gets the \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1Fragments_1_1Factory}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Fragments\+::\+Factory}} instance and returns it.

Sets the station U\+RI to the given Q\+Url \&station\+U\+RI.

Gets the station U\+RI and returns it.

Gets the \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1LiveboardEngine_1_1Board_a0ab6d318f405895f62c6e98cb2d86c6e}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board\+::\+Mode}} mode and returns it.

Sets the Station\+Engine\+::\+Factory instance to the given Station\+Engine\+::\+Factory $\ast$stationfactory.

Gets the Station\+Engine\+::\+Factory instance and returns it.

Sets the \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1LiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} instance we\textquotesingle{}re currently using to the given \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1LiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} $\ast$liveboard.

Gets the \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1LiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} instance we\textquotesingle{}re currently using and returns it.

Handles the incoming \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1Fragments_1_1Page}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Fragments\+::\+Page}} pages from the \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1Fragments_1_1Factory}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Fragments\+::\+Factory}}.

If the user wants to cancel the current operation, this method must be called before performing a new action.

This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It differs from the above function only in what argument(s) it accepts.

Retrieves a \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1LiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} for a station given by it\textquotesingle{}s U\+RI.

Constructs a \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1LiveboardEngine_1_1Factory}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Factory}} if none exists and returns the instance.

Constructs a \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1LiveboardEngine_1_1Factory}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Factory}} to generate \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1LiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} objects on the fly.

Sets the entries of the liveboard to the given Q\+List$<$\+Q\+Rail\+::\+Vehicle\+Engine\+::\+Vehicle $\ast$$>$ \&entries.

Gets the entries of the liveboard and returns it.

Sets the from time to the given Q\+Date\+Time \&from.

Gets the from time and returns it.

Sets the mode of the liveboard to the given \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1LiveboardEngine_1_1Board_a0ab6d318f405895f62c6e98cb2d86c6e}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board\+::\+Mode}} \&mode.

Gets the mode and returns it.

Sets the until time to the given Q\+Date\+Time \&until.

Emits the until\+Changed signal.

Emits the mode\+Changed signal.

Emits the from\+Changed signal.

Emits the entries\+Changed signal.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1LiveboardEngine_1_1Board_a0ab6d318f405895f62c6e98cb2d86c6e}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board\+::\+Mode}} \&mode parameter determines if the the liveboard should contain all the arrivals, departures of the station. Calling this method will retrieve a \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1LiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} for the current time until the current time + 1 hour.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1LiveboardEngine_1_1Board_a0ab6d318f405895f62c6e98cb2d86c6e}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board\+::\+Mode}} \&mode parameter determines if the the liveboard should contain all the arrivals, departures of the station.

New pages are requested if the time range isn\textquotesingle{}t fulfilled in D\+E\+S\+C\+E\+N\+D\+I\+NG order of the departure time.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
If you want to retrieve the full intermediary stops of each vehicle in the \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1LiveboardEngine_1_1Board}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board}} you can use the \mbox{\hyperlink{classQRail_1_1VehicleEngine_1_1Factory}{Q\+Rail\+::\+Vehicle\+Engine\+::\+Factory}}.
\end{DoxyNote}
Parses the incoming pages in a separate thread using the Qt\+Concurrent framework. If the finished parameter is set to true, the Liveboard\+Engine\+::\+Board is ready and the finished signal is emitted.

Emits the station\+U\+R\+I\+Changed signal.
