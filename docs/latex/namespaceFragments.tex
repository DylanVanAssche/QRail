\subsection{Detailed Description}
Constructs a \mbox{\hyperlink{classFragments_1_1Factory}{Fragments\+::\+Factory}} to generate Linked Connections fragments on the fly.

Constructs a \mbox{\hyperlink{classFragments_1_1Factory}{Fragments\+::\+Factory}} if none exists and returns the instance.

Starts the generation process of a \mbox{\hyperlink{classFragments_1_1Page}{Fragments\+::\+Page}} object by requesting a page by U\+RI. When the page is ready, the page\+Ready signal will be emitted.

Starts the generation process of a \mbox{\hyperlink{classFragments_1_1Page}{Fragments\+::\+Page}} object by requesting a page by departure time. When the page is ready, the page\+Ready signal will be emitted.

Sends a request to the \mbox{\hyperlink{classNetwork_1_1Manager}{Network\+::\+Manager}} to retrieve a Linked Connections page by U\+RI.

Converts the J\+S\+O\+N-\/\+LD into a Fragments\+::\+Fragments object and returns it.

Checks the J\+S\+O\+N-\/\+LD data by comparing the expected properties with the received ones.

Reads the network reply, parses it using the helper methods. When the reply is completed parsed and no errors were encountered, the page\+Ready signal is emitted. In case we faced an error, the error signal is emitted with an error message.

Gets the \mbox{\hyperlink{classNetwork_1_1Manager}{Network\+::\+Manager}} instance and returns it.

Sets the \mbox{\hyperlink{classNetwork_1_1Manager}{Network\+::\+Manager}} instance to the given \mbox{\hyperlink{classNetwork_1_1Manager}{Network\+::\+Manager}} $\ast$http.

Constructs a \mbox{\hyperlink{classFragments_1_1Fragment}{Fragment}} to store the information about a Linked Connection fragment for the Connection Scan Algorithm (\mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceCSA}{C\+SA}}).

Retrieves the U\+RI of the linked connection fragment and returns it.

Sets the U\+RI of the linked connection fragment to the given Q\+Url \&uri. Emits the uri\+Changed signal.

Retrieves the departure station U\+RI of the linked connection fragment and returns it.

Sets the departure station U\+RI of the linked connection fragment to the given Q\+Url \&departure\+Station\+U\+RI. Emits the departure\+Station\+U\+R\+I\+Changed signal.

Retrieves the arrival station U\+RI of the linked connection fragment and returns it.

Sets the arrival station U\+RI of the linked connection fragment to the given Q\+Url \&arrival\+Station\+U\+RI. Emits the arrival\+Station\+U\+R\+I\+Changed signal.

Retrieves the departure time of the linked connection fragment and returns it.

Sets the departure time of the linked connection fragment to the given Q\+Date\+Time \&departure\+Time. Emits the departure\+Time\+Changed signal.

Retrieves the arrival time of the linked connection fragment and returns it.

Sets the arrival time of the linked connection fragment to the given Q\+Date\+Time \&arrival\+Time. Emits the arrival\+Time\+Changed signal.

Retrieves the departure delay (in seconds) of the linked connection fragment and returns it.

Sets the departure delay (in seconds) of the linked connection fragment to the given qint16 \&departure\+Delay. Emits the departure\+Delay\+Changed signal.

Retrieves the arrival delay (in seconds) of the linked connection fragment and returns it.

Sets the arrival delay (in seconds) of the linked connection fragment to the given qint16 \&arrival\+Delay. Emits the arrival\+Delay\+Changed signal.

Retrieves the delayed departure time of the linked connection fragment and returns it.

Retrieves the delayed arrival time of the linked connection fragment and returns it.

Retrieves the trip U\+RI of the linked connection fragment and returns it.

Sets the trip U\+RI of the linked connection fragment to the given Q\+Url \&trip\+U\+RI. Emits the trip\+U\+R\+I\+Changed signal.

Retrieves the route U\+RI of the linked connection fragment and returns it.

Sets the route U\+RI of the linked connection fragment to the given Q\+Url \&route\+U\+RI. Emits the route\+U\+R\+I\+Changed signal.

Retrieves the direction of the vehicle in this linked connection fragment and returns it.

Sets the direction of the vehicle in this linked connection fragment to the given Q\+String \&direction. Emits the direction\+Changed signal.

Constructs a \mbox{\hyperlink{classFragments_1_1Page}{Page}} to store the information about a Linked Connection page for the Connection Scan Algorithm (\mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceCSA}{C\+SA}}).

Retrieves the U\+RI of the linked connection page and returns it.

Sets the U\+RI of the linked connection page to the given Q\+Url \&uri. Emits the uri\+Changed signal.

Retrieves the timestamp of the linked connection page and returns it.

Sets the timestamp of the linked connection fragment to the given Q\+Date\+Time \&timestamp. Emits the timestamp\+Changed signal.

Retrieves the U\+RI of the next linked connection page and returns it.

Sets the U\+RI of the linked connection next page to the given Q\+Url \&hydra\+Previous. Emits the hydra\+Previous\+Changed signal.

Retrieves the U\+RI of the previous linked connection page and returns it.

Sets the U\+RI of the linked connection previous page to the given Q\+Url \&hydra\+Previous. Emits the hydra\+Previous\+Changed signal.

Gets the list of fragments associated with this page and return it.

Sets the list of fragments associated with this page to the given Q\+List$<$\+Fragment $\ast$$>$ \&fragments. Emits the fragments\+Changed signal.
